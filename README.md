##  Advanced Usage

[v-voicename] is a voice tag meaning any text written after it will be spoken with that voice.

[e-effectname] is an effect tag which will play an effect.

(reverb) adds reverb to a TTS message.

If you use a tag in a message you MUST use voice tags for all the text you want to say.

‚úÖ`[v-voice] this is text and then an effect [e-effect]`

‚ùå`this text has no voice tag [e-effect]`

‚úÖ`[v-voice] this is text and then an effect [e-effect] [v-voice] and then more text`

‚ùå`[v-voice] this is text and then an effect [e-effect] this text has no voice tag`

‚úÖ`[e-effect] [v-voice] this is text`

‚ùå`[e-effect] this text has no voice tag`

Example of reverb:

`(reverb) this is reverbed text`

`[v-voice] (reverb) this is reverbed text with a specific voice.`
